As we discussed in the class, in order to execute a Search Algorithm, we need to define four items: 

- The State representation
- The State Space 
- The Transition Model 

Furthermore, you will need your code to be more robust to be able to implement other Search Algorithms without drastic changes. More on that later. 

### State representation

In this problem the only state we need to consider is the location of Nick. Therefore we can use the names of the cities as the state.

Since Nick is starting in Arad, going to Bucharest, we can define the initial state and goal state as

```python
initial_state = "Arad"
goal_state = "Bucharest"
```

### The State space

The transition model provides the way to identify the child of a node in a search tree given a specific action. In this problem, we need to translate the whole state space from the geographical network into the program together with the step costs between the connected states.

The important information from the state space is the connections between states and the step costs between connected states. Notice that in this problem the connections are reversible. Therefore in our state space the connection from Arad to Zerind and the connection from Zerind to Arad are identical, hence only one instance of that connection is needed.
    
The most straightforward way of defining the state space is by using a nested array, in which each inner array consists of the two connected states and its cost. 

Define a variable `state_space` to store the state space. The following code shows the first three elements in the nested array. Complete the definition of the variable by referring to the state space provided.

```python
state_space = [
  ['Arad', 'Zerind', 75],
  ['Arad', 'Timisoara', 118],
  ['Timisoara', 'Lugoj', 111],
  ...
]
```

<strong>Task 1: Complete the list of cities and distances in the variable `state_space` </strong>


### The Transition model 

In this problem, the transition model is defined by the action of traveling between connected cities from the current city Nick is in. To represent this, we can create a function that searches through the state space to find the children of the current node, which effectively represents the available actions and transitions.

This function iterates through the `state_space` variable, checking for connections linked to the current node. Each city connected to the current node becomes a child in the search tree. We define a new function called `expandAndReturnChildren` to handle this process.
 
```python
def expandAndReturnChildren(state_space, node):
  children = []
  for [m,n,c] in state_space:
    if m == node:
      children.append(n)
    elif n == node:
      children.append(m)
  return children
```

The function will provide a list of the children of the `node`.


<strong>Task 2: Implement `expandAndReturnChildren` and test its validity</strong>


### Using CLASS & Objects 

Although we can proceed with this code to implement BFS, it will become more complex as we go deeper. To make the code more manageable and flexible for future search algorithms, we can represent each node in the search tree using a class. This approach will not only simplify the code but also make it more robust and adaptable to other search strategies.

To achieve this, we define each city as a <strong>Node</strong>. Key information for each node includes the <strong>state</strong> (representing the city) and the <strong>parent</strong> (the preceding city in the search path).

```python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, state=None, parent=None):
    self.state = state
    self.parent = parent
```

!!! info "Class in Python"
    In Python, to define a class, the class needs to have the function `__init__` with at least one input `self`. This function is called when an object is initiated with this class. The internal variable `self` defines the properties of the object. The input arguments apart from `self` for the function `__init__` are the parameters to be passed when initiating a new object.
    
    In a class, additional functions can also be defined, and these will be the methods for the object of this class. 

With this implementation of node as a class, the `expandAndReturnChildren` function is updated to be

```python
def expandAndReturnChildren(state_space, node):
  children = []
  for [m,n,c] in state_space:
    if m == node.state:
      childnode = Node(n, node)
      children.append(childnode)
    elif n == node.state:
      childnode = Node(m, node)
      children.append(childnode)
  return children
```

<strong>Task 3: Discuss the changes to `expandAndReturnChildren` and the impact of these chagnes on the code functionality </strong>

!!! tip "Quick check"
    Your current code should look like

    ```python
    initial_state = "Arad"
    goal_state = "Bucharest"

    state_space = [
      ['Arad', 'Zerind', 75],
      ['Arad', 'Timisoara', 118],
      ['Timisoara', 'Lugoj', 111],
      ...
    ]

    class Node:
      def __init__(self, state=None, parent=None):
        self.state = state
        self.parent = parent
        
    def expandAndReturnChildren(state_space, node):
      children = []
      for [m,n,c] in state_space:
        if m == node.state:
          childnode = Node(n, node)
          children.append(childnode)
        elif n == node.state:
          childnode = Node(m, node)
          children.append(childnode)
      return children
    ```

### Breadth-first search algorithm

<strong>Problem definition vs. Algoritm Definition</strong> 
    
Next, we will separate the problem definition from the algorithm definition. The algorithm function will take the state space, initial state, and goal state as inputs.

```python
def bfs(state_space, initial_state, goal_state):
```

!!! note "Separation of definitions for problem and algorithm"
    The separation of problem definition from algorithm definition provides significant flexibility and reusability. By isolating the problem setup (such as the state space, initial state, and goal state) from the algorithm, we can easily reuse the algorithm for different problems. For example, the same algorithm can be applied to solve different scenarios by simply changing the problem definition without altering the algorithm itself.
    
    Additionally, this separation allows for the problem definition to be used with different algorithms. Whether we choose <strong>BFS</strong>, <strong>Uniform Cost Search (UCS)</strong>, or <strong>A*</strong>, the same state space, initial state, and goal state can be plugged into various search algorithms, allowing us to experiment with and compare different approaches. This modularity not only simplifies the development process but also promotes cleaner, more maintainable code that can be adapted to new challenges with minimal changes.
    
    
<strong>Implementing the BFS search function</strong> 
    
In this function, we need two empty arrays to store the frontier and the explored states.

```python
def bfs(state_space, initial_state, goal_state):
  frontier = []
  explored = []
```
    
In BFS, we will use the initial state as our root node.

```python
def bfs(state_space, initial_state, goal_state):
  frontier = []
  explored = []
  frontier.append(Node(initial_state, None))
```

!!! info "`Node(initial_state, None)`"
    As the root node has no parent, we use `None` as the value of the parent of root node.
    
When we are generating the search tree, we will continually expanding the first node (FIFO) in the frontier until we generate a node with goal state. Therefore we need to have a loop to repeatedly expanding the first node in the frontier until the goal node is generated.

```python
def bfs(state_space, initial_state, goal_state):
  frontier = []
  explored = []
  found_goal = False
  frontier.append(Node(initial_state, None))
  
  while not found_goal:
    ...
```
    
In the loop we will first expand the first node in the frontier to obtain the children, and move the expanded node from frontier to the explored set.

```python
  while not found_goal:
    # expand the first in the frontier
    children = expandAndReturnChildren(state_space, frontier[0])
    # copy the node to the explored set
    explored.append(frontier[0])
    # remove the expanded node from the frontier
    del frontier[0]
```

Check if the children generated should be added to the frontier or discarded. If any child is expanded previously, i.e. in the explored set, or if it is generated previously but not expanded yet, i.e. in the frontier, then it should be discarded. Else, it should be added to the frontier.

```python
    del frontier[0]
    # loop through the children
    for child in children:
      # check if a node was expanded or generated previously
      if not (child.state in [e.state for e in explored]) and not (child.state in [f.state for f in frontier]):
        # add child to the frontier
        frontier.append(child)
```

!!! info "List comprehension"
    `[e.state for e in explored]` is using the syntax of list comprehension. List comprehension provides a shorter syntax to create a new list. 

    This example loops through the variable `explored` and create a list with the values of `.state` for each element (node) in the `explored` list.

    This one-liner is equivalent to

    ```python
    explored_nodes = []
    for e in explored:
      explored_nodes.append(e.state)
    ```
    
Before a child is added to the frontier, it should be tested for goal. If it has the goal state, the BFS algorithm should be terminated.

```python
      if not (child.state in [e.state for e in explored]) and not (child.state in [f.state for f in frontier]):
        # goal test
        if child.state == goal_state:
          found_goal = True
          goal_node = child
          break
        # add child to the frontiers
        frontier.append(child)
```

Now that the algorithm has identified the goal_node, we can trace the solution through the parent of the goal node all the way back to the root node (node with no parent). Then the function should return the solution of BFS.

```python
  solution = [goal_node.state]
  trace_node = goal_node
  while trace_node.parent is not None:
    solution.insert(0, trace_node.parent.state)
    trace_node = trace_node.parent
  return solution
```

### Running the algorithm
Now we have two functions `expandAndReturnChildren` and `bfs`, alongside with the variables `state_space`, `initial_state`, and `goal_state`.
    
To run a script to execute the `bfs` function, we can have the script file structured as such:

    ```python
    initial_state = 'Arad'
    goal_state = 'Bucharest'
    
    state_space = [
      ...
    ]

    class Node:
      ...

    def expandAndReturnChildren(...):
      ...
      
    def bfs(...):
      ...

    print('Solution: ' + str(bfs(state_space, initial_state, goal_state)))
    ```
    
    
<strong>Task 4: Run and test your BFS Search Algorithm </strong>

## Preparation for next week (Part II)
    
Reusing code is one of the most valuable skills a programmer can develop.

A great way to reuse the code for other search algorithms is to encapsulate it into a library or module, which you can then import and call in future Python programs.

In fact, any `.py` file can be used to define a Python library or module. However, to prevent code outside the functions from executing when the file is imported as a library (instead of being run as a script), we can add an extra condition check.

```python
class Node:
  ...

def expandAndReturnChildren(...):
  ...

def bfs(...):
  ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
  state_space = [
  ...
  ]
  
  initial_state = 'Arad'
  goal_state = 'Bucharest'
  
  print('Solution: ' + str(bfs(state_space, initial_state, goal_state)))
```
    
`__name__` is a special variable in Python that evaluates to the name of the current module. This variable has the value of `'__main__'` if it's called as the main program rather than a module or library.
    
This part is essentially the `main` function in other programming languages like C++ and Java.
    
Execute the script and resolve any error.

<strong>Prep work for Part II</strong>

1. Fully understand the code as you will have to modify the code for other problem/search algorithms in future labs.

2. How would you modify the code to run other uninformed search algorithms such as uniform-cost search, depth-first search, etc.? Which part(s) of the code do you need to modify? Think about it before you work on that in next part of this lab
